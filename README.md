# Omega Attacks Rework

Reworks various Omega attacks and weapon properties so they're faster or better, leading to better gameplay flow and less wasted mana.

## Features

- Default Omega cast now casts automatically when clicking the button, requiring no charge time.
  - Boons that let you aim the cast can still be charged by holding the button. They will simply charge faster.
  - If you have insufficient mana for an Omega cast, the default cast is used.
- Staff
  - Mel is not as rooted in place when using basic attacks.
  - Omega attack now casts immediately after the final attack in the combo.
  - Omega attack deals damage in a circle.
  - Omega special always fires as long as you have sufficient mana.
- Daggers
  - Omega attack now casts immediately before the final attack in the combo without spending mana.
    - The original Omega attack requires a target within a certain distance to do the dash. It will now make Mel dash toward the cursor.
  - Omega special still charges but does so much faster.
  - Both basic special and Omega special have slight homing to make the knives less likely to miss.
    - This applies to any instance in which the special is used, including Daedelus boons that grant different types of Omega specials or cast the special during other moves.
- Torches
  - Both basic attacks and Omega attacks have strong homing.
  - Both basic attacks and Omega attacks are slightly stronger.
  - Omega special casts immediately if you have sufficient mana.
  - Omega special projectiles last longer, and you can cast 6 of them at one time.
- Axe
  - Basic attacks are slightly faster.
  - Omega attack casts immediately after the final attack in the combo if you have sufficient mana.
  - Omega special is untouched because another mod made changes to it that I like and I don't want to copy them nor do I want to do anything different.
- Skull
  - Omega attack casts immediately if you have sufficient mana.
  - Omega special charges significantly faster and provides brief invulnerability similar to a standard dash.
